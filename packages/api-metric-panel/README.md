Once added to a dashboard you can define from where the data should be fetched.

In the result-path you can define the path to your desired value in a dot-notation. If your endpoint for example returns this JSON-response:

```json
{
  "user": "directus",
  "pull_count": 35786947,
  "nested_data": {
    "nested_one": 12,
  }
}
```

You can select `nested_one` by using `nested_data.nested_one` as your request path.

Other settings as request-headers, a custom request-body and a bunch of styling options are available too.
